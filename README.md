# React-Flask-Face-App
#### Description
I created this Facial Recognition App with two parts. Firstly I developed REST API Back End with Flask and Python of course. There is all Recognition Magic happening. Then I created a simple Front End with React JS. If you want to test the app but don't want to add yourself as a new user. Find any of Harry Potter pictures on your phone and show them to your camera then press "Authorisation". Harry has authorization.
